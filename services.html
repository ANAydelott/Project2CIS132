  <h2>The Level of Service We Provide</h2>
  <p>We, at Legacy Listings, will take the time to understand our customers to ensure they are always happy with the level of care we provide.</p>
  <p>After a 30 minute consultation, we will begin to prep a clean and safe work environment to help catalogue assets as: keep, sell, and donate.  You, or your loved one, will be able to review every step of the process.  If mobility is an issue, then we can offer a tablet so the process can be watched through our streaming video service.</p>
  <p>Our catalogers will don white gloves, booties, and safety glasses to make sure every piece is safely handled.  They then will provide before and after photos of every box and contents that will be reviewed for processing.</p>
  <p>For items marked for keep, our designers will wrap and/or place the tiems to be displayed.  For items which will be marked for sale, our researchers will research various markets to see what similiar items have sold for and list accordingly.</p>
  <p>For any items considered for donation, we will catalogue and value for tax purposes so your loved ones can maximize the value of all assets that are processed after completion</p>
  <p>Depending on the size of the project, we will implement different catalgouing methods to allow you or your loved ones to quickly locate and identify their assets.  Larger projects we will implement a barcode system or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to make any future decisions with your asets even easier to process</p>
  <p>We, at Legacy Listings, know how stressful and overwhelming it can be to process years of accumulated assets.  Yet, taking one box at a time, we will help secure your family's legacy for future generations.</p>
